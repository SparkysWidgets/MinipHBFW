"""
 This is a simple example showing how to interface our mini I2C pH interface.
 The usage for this design is very simple, as it uses the MCP3221 I2C ADC.
 Although actual pH calculation is done offboard the analog section is very
 well laid out giving great results at varying input voltages (see vRef for
 adjusting this from say 5v to 3.3v). MinipH can operate from 2.7 to 5.5V to
 accomdate varying levels of system. Power VCC with 3.3v for a raspi!

 ADC samples at ~28.8KSPS @12bit (4096 steps) and has 8 I2C address of from
 A0 to A7 (Default A5) simply assemble the 2 BYTE regiters from the standard
 I2C read for the raw reading.  conversion to pH shown in code.

 Note: MinipH has an optional Vref(4.096V) that can be bypassed as well!
